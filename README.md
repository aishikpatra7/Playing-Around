## Introduction

This is the brainchild of a noob who thought, “Hey, writing `print("hi")` is too easy—let’s make a GUI!” Powered by sheer willpower and a lot of `eval()`, this calculator can handle **basic** arithmetic (and occasional existential crises).

> **Disclaimer:** If it crashes, blames are welcome—but bugs are my new best friends.

## Features

* 🚪 **Open the Door of Mathematics:** Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division (no division by zero—unless chaos is your thing).
* 🎯 **Accuracy (Mostly™):** Results are correct 99% of the time, give or take a rounding error or two.
* 🖼️ **Slick UI:** Built with Tkinter and `ttk`, so it looks fancy enough to impress your grandma.
* 🔄 **`C` Button:** Clear your mistakes...and your self-esteem.

## Installation

1. **Clone this masterpiece**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/you/noob-calculator.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to folder**

   ```bash
   cd noob-calculator
   ```
3. **Install requirements**

   ```bash
   pip install tkinter
   ```

   *(If this fails, it’s probably your Python install’s fault.)*

## Usage

1. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python calculator.py
   ```
2. Click numbers and operators like a digital primate.
3. Press `=` to see miracles (or errors).
4. Press `C` to pretend the last 10 seconds never happened.

## Known Issues (or Glorious 'Features')

* ❗ **Error Messages:** If you type gibberish, you get a majestic `Error`—no further instructions.
* 🐛 **Operator Overload:** Rapid button smashing may summon ghosts.
* 🧩 **No Scientific Mode:** Because where’s the fun without square roots and `sin()`? (Coming… someday… maybe.)

## Future Plans (Dream Big!)🚀

* [ ] Add `math` functions like `sqrt`, `sin`, and `why-did-I-ever-think-this-was-a-good-idea`.
* [ ] Implement theming so you can be emo, neon, or pirate-themed.
* [ ] Write tests... or hire an army of QA engineers.
* [ ] Replace `eval()` with something slightly less terrifying.

## Contributing (If You Dare)

Pull requests and bug reports are welcome! Honestly, I need the help. Just fork the repo, make changes, and pray they don’t break everything.

1. Fork it
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/amazing`
3. Commit your changes: \`git commit -m "Add some magic"
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin feature/amazing`
5. Open a Pull Request and watch the chaos unfold.
